A FCN (Fully Convolutional Neural Network is used in this project to identify people in the given data set and identify a “hero” person for the drone to follow. The dataset (training and validation sets) and the starter code provided by the Udacity and can be found on the project repository: <h> https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning-Project <h>

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook, HTML version of the notebook, write-up document describing the project in detail and finally the pre-trained weights of the model. 

Previously trained model information (h5 documents) can be used to simulate the follow me drone. For further details please check the write-up document.
