# Follow Me Project

A FCN (Fully Convolutional Neural Network is used in this project to identify people in the given data set and identify a “hero” person for the drone to follow. The dataset (training and validation sets) and the starter code provided by the Udacity and can be found on the project repository: <h> https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning-Project <h>

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook, HTML version of the notebook, writeup document describing the project detailly and finally the weights of the model. 

Previously trained model information (h5 documents) can be used to simulate the follow me drone. For further details please check the writeup document.
